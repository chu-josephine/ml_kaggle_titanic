# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project uses the data provided by Kaggle to predict whether the passengers in the test data set survived.  Two data sets (training and test) are provided.  A prediction model is trained using the training data set, and the prediction based on the test data set is submitted to check for accuracy.  A random forest obtained using a grid search with cross-validation is used.
